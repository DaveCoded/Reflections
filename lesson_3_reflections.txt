When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- Collaboration, open source, sharing with colleagues etc.
- Showcasing your work to potential employers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- What if there wasn't space on your computer for the whole repository?
- Might be working on a different branch
- You might disagree with additions to an open source project you're working on and want the old version
